					<p class="appendix-reference">
					See Appendix A for indicator identification reference.<br>
					See Appendix B for battery identification reference.<br>
					See Appendix W for color wheel identification reference.
					</p>

                    <p>The module consists of two screens, each with left and right buttons beside it for navigation for their respective 
					screens. The top screen displays which wire is currently highlighted, pressing that screen will cut the wire that is 
					currently displayed. The defuser has the instructions on which wire to cut with the help of the bottom screen, but is 
					unable to see which wires they have because all of them lie inside the module. The expert will be able to figure out 
					what wires they have with the help of the seed. Only one wire is required to be cut to solve this module.</p>

                    <h3>Figuring out the wires</h3>
					<p>The first line in the bottom screen will show a seed number. The module has 2-7 internal hidden wires which is 
					determined by said number.</p>

					<ul>
                        <li>To get the amount of wires, take the seed and 
						<a href="https://miniwebtool.com/modulo-calculator/">modulate it by 6.</a> 
						<strong>Take the result and add 2 to get the wire count.</strong></li>

						<p></p>
						<li>To get the color of the wires, take the seed and convert it from 
						<a href="http://www.unitconversion.org/numbers/base-10-to-base-6-conversion.html">base-10 to base-6.</a> 
						<strong>Use the table below to convert the numbers into colors.</strong></li>

						<ul>
							<li>You'll recieve 7 digits after converting into base-6. In the event that you have any less than 7 members,
							add 0's at the beginning of your list until you do. The first digit in that arrangement will correspond to the
							first wire, the second digit will correspond to the second wire... <strong>Keep applying this rule until you
							have reached the amount of wires calculated previously</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					
                    <table class="center">
						<tr>
                            <th>Digit</th>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>

					<p>When you have figured out the internal wiring of the module, the defuser can press the bottom left and right buttons
					which will cycle through each list of instructions individually or press the bottom screen to skip to the next section.
					Sections are sorted by wire length which all contain their own exceptions. Exceptions must be followed in order to get
					the correct wire to cut.</p>
